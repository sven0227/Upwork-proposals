TinderWealth is a wealth management fintech startup, with a current team of about 10 people. We are looking for a part-time, experienced DevOps engineer to manage our infrastructure across GitHub and AWS, to set up proactive approaches to avoiding problems (via monitoring and alerting), and to assist with ensuring uptime of the system.

Experience with Terraform required. Tech stack includes: Kubernetes, Django, S3, PostgreSQL, Celery, Redis, and Ubuntu. We make use of numerous common AWS services, so broad familiarity with AWS is desirable.

The role entails implementing best practices around K8s deployments for balancing scaling and cost, ensuring uptime, and health monitoring. We expect the ideal candidate to be strong in debugging infrastructure issues.

In your proposal, please provide a one- or two-paragraph summary of your experience and why you'd be a great fit for this work.
