We're seeking an experienced Gatsby developer. We're adopting a Jamstack architecture, with Gatsby being our chosen framework for the front-end. With the initial designs in place, we're looking to enhance our development speed for the launch of our initial websites.

The philosophy driving our development process is to create a cohesive network of sites that are simple to manage and can seamlessly integrate new features on a global scale.

Therefore, we're in search of a Gatsby expert with substantial expertise in:

- Developing Gatsby themes
- Creating Gatsby plugins
- Utilizing Yarn workspaces
- React and NodeJS.
- Bootstrap and Sass.
- GraphQL
- Internationalization and localization

Integration is key for our sites, which will be connected to a Product Information Management (PIM) system and a content management system. Your tasks will involve fetching and displaying content from these sources, requiring adeptness in GraphQL.

If you have developed a Gatsby site featuring internationalization, localization, authenticated routes, site search, or pagination, it will be considered a significant advantage.
